# SprintBell Development Sprint Overview

Breaking down the SprintBell development into manageable, focused sprints that build upon each other progressively.

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Philosophy

Each sprint should be:

- **Completable in 1-3 focused coding sessions**
- **Demonstrable** with clear visual/functional progress
- **Testable** as a standalone milestone
- **Foundation** for the next sprint
